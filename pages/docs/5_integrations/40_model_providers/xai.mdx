# xAI Integration

The xAI provider in Rig offers integration with OpenAI's API services, supporting both completion and embedding models. It provides a client-based architecture for interacting with xAI's models.

## Basic Usage
To use the xAI module, make sure `rig-core` is added as a dependency to your Rust project (alongside `tokio` with the `macros` and `rt-multi-thread` for the purposes of the example if you want to run the code below). Then you can simply import the xAI provider and use it as below.

> **Note**: Make sure your environment variable `XAI_API_KEY` is set before running the example code.

```rust
use rig::providers::xai;
use rig::Embed;

#[derive(Embed, Debug)]
struct Greetings {
    #[embed]
    message: String,
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), anyhow::Error> {
    // Initialize the xAI client
    let client = xai::Client::from_env();

    let embeddings = client
        .embeddings(xai::embedding::EMBEDDING_V1)
        .document(Greetings {
            message: "Hello, world!".to_string(),
        })?
        .document(Greetings {
            message: "Goodbye, world!".to_string(),
        })?
        .build()
        .await
        .expect("Failed to embed documents");

    println!("{:?}", embeddings);

    Ok(())
}
```

## Available Models
Below is a list of available models that have been added as const variables to the provider module. If there is a supported model you would like to use but is not provided below, you can simply use a string literal instead.

### Completion Models
- `GROK_BETA`: The `grok-beta` completion model.

### Embedding Models
- `EMBEDDING_V1`: The `v1` model (for embeddings).

## Supported Features

### Completions
Find out more about the OpenAI chat completions API [here.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat)

### Embeddings
Find out more about the embeddings API [here.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/embeddings)

### Tool usage
OpenAI also supports tool usage. Rig exposes a public unified API for tool creation and usage that you can find more about here. TODO: Add link
