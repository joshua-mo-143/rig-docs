# DeepSeek Integration

[DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/) is a series of open-source LLMs by the AI-focused company of the same name.

The DeepSeek provider in Rig offers integration with the DeepSeek API, supporting completion models.

Note that to use this module, you will need a DeepSeek API key. 

## Basic Usage

To use the DeepSeek module, make sure `rig-core` is added as a dependency to your Rust project (alongside `tokio` with the `macros` and `rt-multi-thread` for the purposes of the example if you want to run the code below). Then you can simply import the DeepSeek provider and use it as below.

> **Note**: Make sure your environment variable `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` is set before running the example code.

```rust
use rig::{completion::Prompt, providers};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), anyhow::Error> {
    let client = providers::deepseek::Client::from_env();
    let agent = client
        .agent(providers::deepseek::DEEPSEEK_CHAT)
        .preamble("You are a helpful assistant.")
        .build();

    let answer = agent.prompt("Tell me a joke").await?;
    println!("Answer: {}", answer);
    Ok(())
}
```

## Available Models
Below is a list of available models that have been added as const variables to the provider module. If there is a supported model you would like to use but is not provided below, you can simply use a string literal instead.

### Completion models
- `DEEPSEEK_CHAT`: Deepseek chat model (uses DeepSeek-V3).

## Supported Features
Below is a list of supported features for the DeepSeek provider.

### Completions
The completion object follows the Chat Completions standard API (like OpenAI). You can find out more about the completion request and response objects by checking out [the Chat Completions page of the DeepSeek API reference.](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/api/create-chat-completion)
